[[Nb2o5 from CBMM.pdf]]

**Starting phase of Materials**: 
CBMM HP: H-Nb2O5, melting point 1500C
CBMM OG: Multiphases of T, H and M, melting point 1500C
Sigma-aldrich SA: H-Nb2O5. melting point 1490C

'The raised background  at 25 degree for powders annealed below 1200C can suggest the presence of M-Nb2O5.'

T-phase: up to 800C
Mixture of H and M: long term annealing at 900C
H phase: above 1200C
