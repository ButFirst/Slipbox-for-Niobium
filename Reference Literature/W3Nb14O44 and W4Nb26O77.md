[A Comparative Study of Lithium and Sodium Insertion in Two Block Structure Type Phases, W3Nb14O44 and W4Nb26O77](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1557%2FPROC-453-659)

A comparative study of lithium insertion in W4Nb26O77 and W3Nb14O44, two block structure type phases, has been carried out. This process is, in both cases, reversible for a similar number of lithium ions incorporated to total metal atoms ratio (Li/Î£M), 1.15 in W3Nb14O44 and 1.23 in W4Nb26O77.
